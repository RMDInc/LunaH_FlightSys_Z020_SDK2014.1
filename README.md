# LunaH_DevKit_Z020_SDK2014_1_Flight

This is the flight software being developed at RMD. This version of the software receives commands as listed in the Instrument Control Document and responds appropriately. The data returned and saved to files on the SD card are not currently random placeholders, but the return values are in the correct format and data type expected.
